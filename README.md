# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this project I created three HTML pages. 
First page is to login users to this Web application. 
Next one contains all channels and enables to create a new one.
And the last page includes current channel with the ability to send text messages to others(with display name and timestamp).
With Socketio, I am able to implement live messaging between users in real time.
If a user closes the page and returns to the app later, the display name is remembered.
My application stores the 100 most recent messages per channel.
